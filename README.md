we have 7 - 10 weeks, we need to follow software development process (Agile). Having a sprint each week.
Think about what problem each project solves






- Week	Dates	Sprint Goal / Process	Timeline / Milestone	Status
- 1	Sept 8 â€“ 12	Brainstorm project ideas, evaluate feasibility, pick final idea.		
- 2	Sept 15 â€“ 19	Define requirements (user stories, acceptance criteria). Start backlog creation.		
- 3	Sept 22 â€“ 26	Refine backlog, finalize scope, outline architecture. Plan how the project will look (rough sketch / diagram).	ðŸ“Œ Project Proposal due Sept. 28
